/**
 * User data synchronization handler interface.
 *
 * Implemented by CDP (Customer Data Platform) and CRM integrations that support
 * bidirectional user data sync:
 *
 *   Inbound:  External platform → Quackback
 *     Receives user identify/update events and writes attributes to user.metadata.
 *     Example: Segment or RudderStack sends an `identify` call when a user's
 *     plan changes; Quackback updates user.metadata and re-evaluates segments.
 *
 *   Outbound: Quackback → External platform
 *     After dynamic segment evaluation, pushes membership changes back as user
 *     attributes so the external platform knows which segments each user
 *     belongs to.
 *     Example: a user joins the "Enterprise" segment → Segment receives an
 *     `identify` call with `{ traits: { enterprise: true } }`.
 *
 * Both methods are optional. An integration may implement either or both:
 *   - Inbound only:  CDP sends identify events; we update user attributes
 *   - Outbound only: Push segment membership to a CRM after evaluation
 *   - Bidirectional: Full two-way sync
