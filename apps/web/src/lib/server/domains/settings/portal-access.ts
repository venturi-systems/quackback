/**
 * Pure function — no I/O. Returns a typed access decision.

 * Execution order:
 * 1. Public portal → always granted.
 * 2. Authenticated portal + real signed-in account → granted.
 * 3. Team member (admin | member) → granted.
 * 3. Verified email on allowed-domain list → granted.
 * 4. Accepted portal invite (email match, verified) → granted.
 * 5. Allowed segment grant (authenticated member of an allowed segment) → granted.
 * 6. Widget sign-in: enabled + authenticated + via-widget marker + HMAC mode → granted.
 * 7. No real session → unauthenticated (redirect to login).
 * 8. Authenticated but no matching grant → unauthorized (show access-denied screen).
 *
 * Ordering: team > domain > invite > segment > widget. The widget branch is intentionally
 * last among grant paths so that a more-specific grant (team, domain, invite, segment)
 * is preferred when the user qualifies for multiple paths.
 *
 * Widget branch requires THREE conditions beyond `isAuthenticated`:
 *   - `widgetSignInEnabled` — admin explicitly enabled widget sign-in.
 *   - `hasViaWidgetMarker` — the session was created via the handoff route
 *     (prevents self-registered portal users from gaining the grant).
 *   - `identifyVerificationEnabled` — workspace requires HMAC-verified
 *     widget identity (prevents email-capture mode from granting portal
 *     access, which would bypass the verified-identity intent).
