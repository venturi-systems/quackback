/**
 * Anonymous-principal sweep. Durable anon tokens (P0.1) keep anonymous
 * principals around far longer than the old per-session lifetime, so abandoned
 * empties accumulate and degrade the per-IP anon-vote rate limit (which JOINs
 * sessions + principals). This reclaims them.
 *
 * Only TRULY EMPTY anon principals are deleted — created beyond the retention
 * window, no live session, and no content anywhere (posts/votes/comments/
 * comment_reactions/conversations/messages/subscriptions/notifications). A
 * principal that authored anything is left untouched.
 *
 * The NOT EXISTS list must cover every table where an anon actor can author
 * content, because the FKs are a mix: chat FKs are onDelete:restrict (a missed
 * one would throw and be caught), but content like comment_reactions is
 * onDelete:CASCADE — a missing guard there would NOT throw; it would silently
 * cascade-delete real content. So the guard, not the catch block, is the
 * safety net for cascade tables. (notification_preferences / unsubscribe_tokens
 * also cascade but are derived preference state, so sweeping them is intended.)
 * Each principal is still removed in its own transaction so an unexpected
 * restrict reference skips just that row rather than failing the batch.
