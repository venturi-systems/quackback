/**

 * visitor is a member of that segment (the membership tables themselves are
 * owned by the segments domain; this only reads them for the inbox).
 *
 * Deliberately a thin chat-side helper rather than living in the segments
 * domain, because the count it returns is chat-specific (open conversations),
 * mirroring `listChatTagsWithCounts` so the two nav groups read identically.
 * Authorization is enforced at the server-fn layer, not here.
