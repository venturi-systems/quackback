/**
 * Lightweight cross-instance mutex for scheduled maintenance tasks.
 *
 * Uses a Postgres table as a distributed lock so daily sweepers
 * (audit log prune, invite expiry) execute at most once across all
 * replicas in a multi-instance deployment.
 *
 * Mechanism: INSERT ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE with a `setWhere` expiry
 * guard. The first instance that inserts a row for a given lock name
 * wins; others get zero rows returned via `.returning()` and skip.
 * On the next interval tick the existing row has expired, so the
 * INSERT succeeds for whoever claims it first.
 *
 * If a process dies mid-sweep, the TTL auto-releases the lock so the
 * next interval tick proceeds — no orphaned locks left behind.
