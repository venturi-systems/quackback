/**
 * Auth Restrictions — request-time policy oracle for sign-in attempts.
 *
 * Wired by Better-Auth's per-endpoint `hooks.before` middleware (Layer B)
 * for paths where the email is in `ctx.body` (password, magic-link,
 * email-OTP). For OAuth callback paths the email isn't known until
 * after the upstream token exchange, so policy enforcement on those
 * paths is split between Layer A (provider registration filter) and
 * Layer C (`hooks.after` compensating cleanup).
 *
 * Provider-id conventions follow Better-Auth's path-derived ids:
 *   - 'credential'   — email/password
 *   - 'magic-link'   — magic-link or email-OTP (one combined method)
 *   - OIDC reg id    — a genericOAuth provider's registrationId
 *                       (incl. the preserved legacy 'sso' / 'custom-oidc')
 *   - social id      — built-in social ('google', 'github', …)
 *
 * Hard-binding is per-domain AND per-owning-provider: when a verified-domain
 * row has `enforced=true`, emails at that domain are blocked from every
 * method EXCEPT the owning provider's own OIDC callback — password,
 * magic-link, social, and a *different* OIDC provider are all blocked.
 * Without enforcement, verification is routing-only and other methods stay
 * open.

 * **Fails open — but scoped to the owner — when the IdP isn't viable.** If
 * the enforced domain's OWN provider isn't currently registered (tier
 * downgrade, missing secret, disabled) the block lifts so admins aren't
 * locked out. The gate is `registeredProviderIds.has(owner.registrationId)`,
