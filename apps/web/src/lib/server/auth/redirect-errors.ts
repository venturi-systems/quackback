/**
 * Pre-check redirect surfacing for the better-auth client.
 *
 * When `handleSignInPreCheck` blocks a sign-in (rate-limited,
 * verified-domain hard-bound, the method is disabled for the
 * principal's audience), it returns a 302 to /admin/login or
 * /auth/login with `?error=<code>`. fetch follows the redirect by
 * default, the auth client parses the (HTML) body as null JSON, and
 * the awaiting form sees `{ data: null, error: null }` — interpreted
 * as success. The form fires its `onSuccess` path and the popover
 * silently closes with no session and no message.
 *
 * `detectAuthBlockRedirect` lets the client's `onResponse` hook turn
 * those redirects into a thrown `AuthBlockedError` so the form's
 * existing try/catch surfaces a friendly message.
 *
 * The exported `AUTH_BLOCK_MESSAGES` map is also imported by
 * `/admin/login` (and any future surface that consumes a pre-check
 * error code) so the wording stays in one place.
