-- The team member who tracked this post from a support conversation, on the
-- customer's behalf. The post's author stays the customer (principal_id); this
-- records who acted so the admin UI can show "tracked by X on behalf of Y".
-- Additive + backfill-safe (existing rows get NULL). Set null if the agent's
-- principal is later removed.
